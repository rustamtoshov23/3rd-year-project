# 3rd-year-project
Here I will include mainly coding but also later everything else I used and need for my 3rd year project on segmenting tightly packed cells that share boundaries using machine learning

## Update 04/01/2026
I am going to fork in the code for the metrics to determine how good segmentation algorithms are. Need to shorten down the code to only what I need, will hopefully do it tomorrow.
