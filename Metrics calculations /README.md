# Updates on progress

## Update 05/01/2026
Tried looking into the metrics.py file, do not want to risk it, so left the code as it is for now. Downloaded all other codes from the initial folder as metrics depends on them.
Also, to run metrics, asked Copilot to create a virtual environment with some special packages installed. 
God knows what it did, there is like 10,000 lines of code...
